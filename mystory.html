                A Delhi based Photographer and content creator, I love exploring off beat locations in and around my city and capturing them on my camera. I began photography one and a half years ago as a chance incidence but ever since, it has been my passion. It has been making me feel alive ever since I took my first best shot.

                Photography cannot be forced neither upon the subject nor upon the person behind the lens, it always comes from within.  Photography for me is the art of telling stories, freezing time and stealing moments. With every picture that I create, each genre that I work in, I love exploring a hidden story, adding meaning to my frame and bringing out that story for those not present in the moment.

                I love clicking the streets. Raw and in all their glore. So ordinary yet so spevial. Full of everyday activities yet brimming with surprises. Travel or Heritage is the genre which appeals to me as a free soul, an explorer. Product and Portraiture are the genres I prefer to sustain myself, to make a living while also doing the thing I love the most.

                The genres on this site majorly covered are travel, street, product and portraits. Most of the street and travel shots have been captured on my exploration in my city. Some shots included in the portraits and product sections have been shot for educational purposes as well as commercial purposes.
